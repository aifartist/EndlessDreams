# EndlessDreams
The generation of endless real-time interactive dreams

## History of real-time Stable Diffusion
**Jan 2022**: Retired as a database performance architect at Microsoft.  
**Aug 2022**: Learned of Stable Diffusion and was hooked.  
**Dec 2022**: Bought hi-end system with Ubuntu, i9-13900K and a 4090.  
Spent little time on "art?". Most of my time was spent pushing the performance of SD to the max. For me the question was: How many milliseconds do I need to generate an image? I was learning python, stable diffusion internals, and optimization techniques making continuous progress.  
**Oct 2023**: Simian Luo announces LCM. Prior to Oct the dreams of real-time AI video generations were just a fantasy. With LCM I saw that its time was **NOW**. Within hours of LCM dropping I had what **might** have been the first real-time video generations running on my 4090 and I posted examples to reddit and elsewhere. By real-time I don't mean the Youtube demoes starting to appear in Nov/Dec 2023 claiming real-time SD videos at 3 to 5 fps. I started out of the gate at 10fps and quickly got to 15 fps with SD1.5. Then 33 fps for 800x800 SDXL, 22 fps 1024x1024, 17 fps 1280x1024, and I continued to this day to make things faster.

Deepfakes had been around for awhile. However, I realized I could do real-time deepfakes where I looked like Trump/Biden or Emma Watson/Tom Cruise on camera.  TODO: Add link to reddit post

I coined the term RTSD and demoed the ability to, in real-time, generate images on the fly as one changed the prompt or other paramaters using sliders. Instant feedback vs making a change, clicking generate and then waiting. TODO: Add link

## The Dawn of Multimodal Exploration of Your Creativity
Imagine sitting back in your easy chair dictating your dreams using verbal prompts and commands like zoom in/out, pan left/right/up/down and seeing the results instantly. Imagine being surprised when a famous person appears and you realize; Oh, I have the TV on in the background and they were just talking about that person.

Open source is down the road given I don't have the resources of a $10 billion company like Midjourney which announced the long term goal of doing exactly what I've been doing for months.  My one-man show will start with a no-
